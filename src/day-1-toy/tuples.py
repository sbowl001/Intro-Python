# Tuples are like lists, but are immutable and are usually used to hold
# heterogenous data. They use parens instead of square brackets.

# Example:

import math

def dist(a, b):
    """Compute the distance between two x,y points."""
    x0, y0 = a  # Destructuring assignment
    x1, y1 = b
    
    return math.sqrt((x1 - x0)**2 + (y1 - y0)**2)

a = (2, 7)   # <-- x,y coordinates stored in tuples
b = (-14, 72)

# Prints "Distance is 66.94"
print("Distance is: {:.2f}".format(dist(a, b)))



# Write a function that prints all the values in a tuple

# def print_tuple(...
def tuple(t, u):

    t = (1, 2, 5, 7, 99)
    #print(print_tuple(t))  # Prints 1 2 5 7 99, one per line
    print_tuple(t)
# Declare a tuple of 1 element then print it


    u = (1,)  # What needs to be added to make this work?
    print(u)
   # print_tuple(u)
